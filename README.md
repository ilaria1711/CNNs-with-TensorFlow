# CNNs-with-TensorFlow
Convolutional neural networks for advanced image recognition and classification:
this repository contains my completed exercises and notes from the *Program Neural Networks with TensorFlow* (https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/tensorflow#codelab-https://developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-6-largecnns) course by Google Developers.

## Overview:
- Introduction to computer vision: build and train a DNN, experiment with layers
- Introduction to Convolutions: convolutions, pooling, feature map
- Convolutional Neural Networks: improve accuracy with convolutions
- CNNs with complex images: recognize features in an image where the subject is not clear
- CNNs with larger dataset: use a real world large dataset, avoid overfitting

## Technologies:
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

This is part of my journey into machine learning and deep learning. Check out the notebooks for commented code and explanations.
